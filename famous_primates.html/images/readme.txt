The Famous Primates Images

We're pleased to have partnered with iStockphoto to provide you with some images of primates for use as part of your homework. As part of our agreement with iStockphoto we are required to supply this Read Me! file with some small print.

Although we're providing you with these images to enable you to undertake each chapter's task, the images remain the copyright of iStockphoto and may not be used for other purposes.

iStockphoto is happy for us to offer you these images for educational purposes, however, should you plan on making your Famous Primates web site publicly available, you will need to purchase licenses for the images at a cost of just a few dollars. (Or, alternatively, replace them with images of your own.)

Should you wish to purchase a license for the primates we've used, we have provided links to the relevant images here.
